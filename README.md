## What is Crescent Network?

Crescent Network is a DeFi Hub in Cosmos ecosystem with a goal of empowering usersâ€™ digital assets for maximizing their financial returns while managing associated risks in the most efficient way by providing innovative and sophisticated DeFi products. In the base layer, Crescent core has the following unique characteristics.

- Hybrid DEX: a combination of Automated Market Maker (AMM) and Order Book models.
- Ranged Pool: next generation Automated Market Maker that increases capital efficiency. Liquidity is allocated within a predefined price range.
- Batch Execution : all deposits, withdrawals, and orders are accumulated in a batch and they are fairly executed at the same time.
- Novel DeFi products are on the way!
