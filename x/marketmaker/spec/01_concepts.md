 # Concepts

## Market Maker

Market makers provide liquidity to the exchange by placing orders which are not executed immediately. These orders make it easy for traders to trade against provided market maker orders without waiting.

## Market Maker Incentives

Market makers can earn CRE as incentives for providing liquidity. These incentives are calculated for each month by the off-chain market maker scoring system and distribute incentives based on the allocation suggested by governance proposals.

## Inclusion of Market Maker

Any Crescent address can apply as a market maker for selected market pairs. A governance process decides inclusion, rejection and exclusion of registered market makers.
