# Transaction

## CreatePair

Create a pair (market) for trading.

A pair consists of a base coin and a quote coin and you can think of a pair in an order book. An orderer can request a limit or market order once a pair is created. Anyone can create a pair by paying a fee `PairCreationFee` (default is 1000000stake).

Usage

```bash
create-pair [base-coin-denom] [quote-coin-denom]
```

| **Argument**     | **Description**                      |
| :--------------- | :----------------------------------- |
| base-coin-denom  | denom of the base coin for the pair  |
| quote-coin-denom | denom of the quote coin for the pair |

Example

```bash
# Create a pair ATOM/UST
crescentd tx liquidity create-pair uatom uusd \
--chain-id localnet \
--from alice \
--keyring-backend test \
--broadcast-mode block \
--yes \
--output json | jq

#
# Tips
#
# You can query pairs using the following command
crescentd q liquidity pairs -o json | jq
```

## CreatePool

Create a liquidity pool in existing pair.

Pool(s) belong to a pair. Therefore, a pair must exist in order to create a pool. Anyone can create a pool by paying a fee PoolCreationFee (default is 1000000stake).

Usage

```bash
create-pool [pair-id] [deposit-coins]
```

| **Argument**  | **Description**                        |
| :------------ | :------------------------------------- |
| pair-id       | pair id                                |
| deposit-coins | deposit amount of base and quote coins |

Example

```bash
# Create a pool 1000ATOM/3000UST
crescentd tx liquidity create-pool 1 1000000000uatom,3000000000uusd \
--chain-id localnet \
--from alice \
--keyring-backend test \
--broadcast-mode block \
--yes \
--output json | jq

#
# Tips
#
# You can query pools using the following command
crescentd q liquidity pools -o json | jq
```

## CreateRangedPool

Create a ranged liquidity pool in existing pair.

Pool(s) belong to a pair. Therefore, a pair must exist in order to create a pool. Anyone can create a pool by paying a fee PoolCreationFee (default is 1000000stake).

Usage

```bash
create-ranged-pool [pair-id] [deposit-coins] [min-price] [max-price] [initial-price]
```

| **Argument**  | **Description**                        |
| :------------ | :------------------------------------- |
| pair-id       | pair id                                |
| deposit-coins | deposit amount of base and quote coins |
| min-price     | minimum price of the pool              |
| max-price     | maximum price of the pool              |
| initial-price | initial pool price                     |

Example

```bash
# Create a ranged pool with 1000ATOM/1000UST with price range of [2.5, 10.0],
# with initial price set to 3.0
crescentd tx liquidity create-ranged-pool 1 1000000000uatom,1000000000uusd 2.5 10.0 3.0 \
--chain-id localnet \
--from alice \
--keyring-backend test \
--broadcast-mode block \
--yes \
--output json | jq

#
# Tips
#
# You can query pools using the following command
crescentd q liquidity pools -o json | jq
```

## Deposit

Deposit coins to a liquidity pool.

Deposit uses a batch execution methodology. Deposit requests are accumulated in a batch for a pre-defined period (default is 1 block) and they are executed at the end of the batch. A minimum deposit amount is 1000000 for each denomination.

Note that in an order book system, a pool is considered as an orderer. A liquidity in the pool places orders conservatively. What that means is that it places buy orders lower than the pool price and places sell orders higher than the pool price.

Usage

```bash
deposit [pool-id] [deposit-coins]
```

| **Argument**  | **Description**                        |
| :------------ | :------------------------------------- |
| pool-id       | pool id                                |
| deposit-coins | deposit amount of base and quote coins |

Example

```bash
# Deposit 10ATOM/30UST to the pool
crescentd tx liquidity deposit 1 10000000uatom,30000000uusd \
--chain-id localnet \
--from alice \
--keyring-backend test \
--broadcast-mode block \
--yes \
--output json | jq

#
# Tips
#
# You can query deposit requests by using the following command
# You must query this right away to get the result
# Otherwise, it is removed as it is executed.
crescentd q liquidity deposit-requests 1 -o json | jq
```

## Withdraw

Withdraw coins from the liquidity pool.

Withdraw uses a batch execution methodology. Withdraw requests are accumulated in a batch for a pre-defined period (default is 1 block) and they are executed at the end of the batch.

Usage

```bash
withdraw [pool-id] [pool-coin]
```

| **Argument** | **Description**                 |
| :----------- | :------------------------------ |
| pool-id      | pool id                         |
| pool-coin    | amount of pool coin to withdraw |

Example

```bash
# Withdraw pool coin from the pool
crescentd tx liquidity withdraw 1 500000000000pool1 \
--chain-id localnet \
--from alice \
--keyring-backend test \
--broadcast-mode block \
--yes \
--output json | jq

#
# Tips
#
# You can query withdraw requests by using the following command
# You must query this right away to get the result
# Otherwise, it is removed as it is executed.
crescentd q liquidity withdraw-requests 1 -o json | jq
```

## LimitOrder

Make a limit order.

Buy limit order will be matched at lower than or equal to the defined order price whereas sell limit order will be matched at higher than or equal to the defined order price.

Order uses a batch execution methodology. Order requests are accumulated in a batch for a pre-defined period (default is 1 block) and they are executed at the end of the batch.

Usage

```bash
limit-order [pair-id] [direction] [offer-coin] [demand-coin-denom] [price] [amount]
```

| **Argument**      | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

| offer-coin        | amount of coin that the orderer offers to swap for the demand coin denom; it varies depending on swap direction (buy or sell). Buy direction requires quote coin whereas sell direction requires base coin. For buy direction, quote coin amount must be greater than or equal to price \* amount. For sell direction, base coin amount must be greater than or equal to the amount value. |
| demand-coin-denom | demand coin denom that the orderer is willing to swap for                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| price             | order price; the exchange ratio is the amount of quote coin over the amount of base coin. It must be between 90% and 110% of the last price. This means the price change can only be between -10% and +10%.                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

An Example of Buying Direction

```bash
#
# Pair: ATOM / USDT where ATOM is `BaseCoinDenom` and USDT is `QuoteCoinDenom`
#
# Let’s say you want to buy ATOM with 50 USDT (50*10^6uusd)
#
# You first have to query the last price of the pair
# 
# Assuming the last price is 3.0, it is up to your discretion
# what order price you want to place an order with.
#
# [Case 1]
# If you want your order to be executed to buy ATOM right away,
# you must place an order with an order price above the last price.
# e.g) 3.1, 3.2, 3.3 (max limit)
#
# [Case 2]
# If you are willing to wait until your order is executed at certain price,
# then place an order with an order price that is less than or equal to the last price.
#
# It is important to note that the order price must be between 90% and 110% of the last price 
# for the price change to be between -10% and +10%. 
# Our DEX is designed in this way to minimize computational resources 
# and improve performance issue. 
#
# In regards of the `amount` field, it is how many ATOM you want to buy.
# It is important to note that OfferCoinAmount/OrderPrice is the maximum amount you can buy and
# the amount value multiply by order price cannot be more than the offer coin amount.
# 
# To describe the CLI below, 
# it means you want to buy 17241379 amount of uatom by offering 50000000uusd with an order price of 2.9, which is lower than
# the current last price of the pair.
# You are placing an order with an intention to wait until your order is matched and executed at 2.9.
#
# Place a limit order to buy

An Example of Selling Direction

```bash
#

#
# Let’s say you want to sell 50 ATOM (50*10^6uatom) for USDT
#
# You first have to query the last price of the pair
# 
# Assuming the last price is 3.0, it is up to your discretion
# what order price you want to place an order with.
#
# [Case 1]
# If you want your order to be executed to sell ATOM right away,
# you must place an order with an order price below the last price.
# e.g) 2.9, 2.8, 2.7 (max limit)
# 
# [Case 2]
# If you are willing to wait until your order is executed at certain price,
# then place an order with an order price that is more than or equal to the last price.
#
# It is important to note that the order price must be between 90% and 110% of the last price 
# for the price change to be between -10% and +10%. 
# Our DEX is designed in this way to minimize computational resources

#
# In regards of the `amount` field, it is a number of ATOMs you want to sell.
# 
# To describe the CLI below, 
# it means you want to sell 50000000 all amounts by offering 50000000uatom for uusd with an order price of 2.7.
# You are placing an order with an intention to sell it immediately with any amounts placed in the orderbook pair.
# OfferCoinAmount is the maximum amount you can sell.
#
# Place a limit order to sell

## MarketOrder

Make a market order.

Unlike a limit order, there is no need to input order price.

Buy market order uses `MaxPriceLimitRatio` of the last price, which is `LastPrice * (1+MaxPriceLimitRatio)`.

Sell market order uses negative MaxPriceLimitRatio of the last price, which is `LastPrice * (1-MaxPriceLimitRatio)`.

Order uses a batch execution methodology. Order requests are accumulated in a batch for a pre-defined period (default is 1 block) and they are executed at the end of the batch.

Usage

```bash
market-order [pair-id] [direction] [offer-coin] [demand-coin-denom] [amount]
```
