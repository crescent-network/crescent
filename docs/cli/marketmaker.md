# Marketmaker Module

## Synopsis

This document provides a high-level overview of how the command line (CLI) interface works for the `marketmaker` module.

## Command Line Interfaces

  - [ApplyMarketMaker](#ApplyMarketMaker)

# Transaction

## ApplyMarketMaker

Apply as a market maker with this transaction message. A market maker can apply for a single or multiple pairs, and the community will decide if they are well fit to be included in the whitelisted market makers group to become eligible.

It is important to note that not all pairs in the liquidity module are available in genesis. Each pair must be approved by the community and be registered in params.

For testing purpose, pair 1 and 2 are pre-registered in the `config-test.yml` file.

Usage

```bash
crescentd tx marketmaker apply [pool-ids]
```

| **Argument** | **Description** |
| :----------- | :-------------- |
| pool-ids     | pool id(s)      |

Example

```bash
# Apply as a market maker for pair 1
crescentd tx marketmaker apply 1 \
--chain-id localnet \
--from alice \
--keyring-backend test \
--broadcast-mode block \
--yes \
--output json | jq

# Apply as a market maker for pair 1 and 2
crescentd tx marketmaker apply 1,2 \
--chain-id localnet \
--from alice \
--keyring-backend test \
--broadcast-mode block \
--yes \
--output json | jq

#
# Tips
#

# Query params to see which pairs are available to apply as a market maker
# For testing purpose, pair 1 and 2 are pre-registered
crescentd q marketmaker params -o json | jq

# Note that there must be governance proposal to include the applied market maker to become eligible
# Now, the returned value must be empty.
crescentd q marketmaker marketmakers -o json | jq
```

## IncludeMarketMaker

For testing purpose, create a `proposal.json` file to include the applied market maker.

```json
{
  "title": "Market Maker Proposal",
  "description": "Include the following market makers",
  "inclusions": [
    {
      "address": "cre1zaavvzxez0elundtn32qnk9lkm8kmcszxclz6p",
      "pair_id": "1"
    }
  ],
  "exclusions": [],
  "rejections": [],
  "distributions": [
    {
      "address": "cre1zaavvzxez0elundtn32qnk9lkm8kmcszxclz6p",
      "pair_id": "1",
      "amount": [
        {
          "denom": "stake",
          "amount": "100000000"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

Example

```bash
# Create a proposal
crescentd tx gov submit-proposal market-maker-proposal proposal.json \
--gas 400000 \
--chain-id localnet \
--from alice \
--deposit 100000000stake \
--keyring-backend=test \
--broadcast-mode block \
--yes \
--output json | jq

# Vote
# For testing purpose, voting period is shortened to 10 seconds.
crescentd tx gov vote 1 yes \
--chain-id localnet \
--from alice \
--keyring-backend=test \
--broadcast-mode block \
--yes \
--output json | jq

#
# Tips
#

# Query all proposals
crescentd q gov proposals -o json | jq

# Query all market makers to see if the applied market maker's eligible is true now
crescentd query marketmaker marketmakers -o json | jq
```

## ClaimIncentives

Usage

crescentd tx marketmaker claim
```

Example

```bash
# First, query to see if there is any incentive to claim
crescentd tx marketmaker claim \
--chain-id localnet \
--from alice \
--keyring-backend test \
--broadcast-mode block \
--yes \
--output json | jq

#
