# Abstract

The scoring system is for off-chain evaluation of market maker performance from on-chain data stored in Crescent Network

# Concepts

## Spread

Spread(or Bid-ask spread) measures the distance of 2-sided liquidity. It represents the minimum cost of liquidity consumption. Spread is a price difference between the lowest ask and highest bid.

## Width

Width(ask or bid) indicates the difference between each side of the order’s maximum and minimum price. The market price does not stand still, so the proper width of maker orders helps stay stable.

## Depth

Depth(ask or bid) is the total order amount on each side. If market depth is insufficient enough to handle large trade amounts, market liquidity is low despite its narrow spread.

## Uptime

Uptime measures the availability of liquidity. High uptime ensures that users can trade at any time they want. Uptime is calculated as a percentage of time a market maker provides orders.

## Market Maker Order Type

Market makers are provided a particular order type to place and cancel multiple market-making orders by a single transaction. This specific order type allows market makers atomic placement of a group of limit orders, minimizing broadcasting failures and burdens.

# Scoring

## Methodology

- The evaluation objective is to reward market makers who consistently provide tight and deep liquidity for users.
- Market makers earn points according to liquidity contribution, which means there is a score cap per block.
- The calculation is done off-chain based on on-chain blockchain data. The codebase is publicly available for any third-party verification.

## Market Maker Eligibility

- Market maker eligibility is decided by governance every month.
- Only registered market makers can earn incentives based on their scores. Market makers who fail to meet the uptime requirements are also given their month incentives.
- New applicants are requested to submit ApplyMarketMaker transaction to be included in the uptime evaluation. Those who meet the uptime requirement will be included in eligible market makers through governance.
- The governance can exclude existing market makers who fail to meet the requirements for 2 consecutive months or 3 months within the last 5 months.

## Market Maker Orders Requirement

- Orders satisfying following conditions can be recognized and evaluated:
  - Use MMOrder from eligible MMAddress
  - `Spread`equal or smaller than `MaxSpread`
  - Min(`AskWidth`,`BidWidth`) equal or larger than `MinWidth`
  - Min(`AskDepth`,`BidDepth`) equal or larger than `MinDepth`
- Parameters (bottom of the document) are assigned differently for each pair depending on the market characteristics, and can be adjusted by governance

## Uptime Requirement

- Uptime requirement is measured in 2 stages:
  - `LiveHour` is added as market maker provide valid orders for an hour. Following 1 out of 2 conditions, it fails:
    - No valid orders longer than `MaxDowntime` in a row
    - No valid orders longer than `MaxTotalDowntime` total in an hour
  - `LiveDay` is added as `LiveHour` is equal or larger than `MinHours` in a day
- Those who earn`LiveDay` equal or larger than `MinDays` satisfy the uptime requirement.
- Parameters (bottom of the document) are decided and adjusted by governance.

## Formula

- Following formula is used to compute how much incentives should be rewarded to each market maker per month. The amount of CRE earned is determined by the relative share of each market maker’s score.

1. First step (within a block)
   - Calculate 2-sided liquidity point and take minimum value (take integer part)
     $P = min \lbrack{ {AskQ1}\over{AskD1^2} }+ { {AskQ2}\over{AskD2^2} } + ... , { {BidQ1}\over{BidD1^2} }+ { {BidQ2}\over{BidD2^2} } + ... \rbrack$
2. Second step (within a block)
   - Obtain contribution score by taking protportion of the point within the block
     $P_m \over \sum_i P_i$
3. Third step (within a month)
   - Calculate `Uptime` by dividing `LiveHour` with total hours in a month
     U = Total `LiveHour` / Total hours in a month
4. Forth step (Final score)
   - Final score of market maker “m” is as following :

$$
S_m = {U_m} ^3 \sum_{t=1}^{B} \lbrack { P_{mt} \over \sum_i P_{it} }\rbrack
$$

     U_m : % of Market maker m’s uptime in the month
     B  : Total number of blocks for the month
     P_mt : Liquidity point of market maker 'm' at block 't'

## Processing Order data

- All variables are used as final values after the trade is made.
- Even if the order of n-th tick is partially filled, the tick can still be a reference point(whether the highest bid or lowest ask) of measures when one of the following conditions is met. If not, the following tick becomes the reference point.
- Min(`AskQ(n)`,`BidQ(n)`) is equal or larger than `MinOpenRatio` of the original order
- Min(`AskQ(n)`,`BidQ(n)`) is equal or larger than `MinOpenDepthRatio` of `MinDepth`

## Measures

- Breadth
  - `MidPrice` : Average price of lowest ask and highest bid
  - `Spread` : Price difference between lowest ask and highest bid divide by `MidPrice`
  - `AskWidth` : Price difference between maximum and minimum ask divided by `MidPrice`. `BidWidth` is same with bid prices
  - `AskD(n)` : Price difference between `MidPrice` and n-th ask price divided by `MidPrice`. `BidD(n)` is same with bid prices
- Depth
  - `AskQ(n)`,`BidQ(n)` : The amount of token remaining in n-th tick
  - `AskDepth`,`BidDepth` : Total amount of token remaining in ask or bid side

## Example

![2](2.png)

- Assume `MaxSpread` 0.012, `MinWidth` 0.002, `MinDepth` 100, `MinOpenRatio` 0.5, `MinOpenDepthRatio` 0.1
