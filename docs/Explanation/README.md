## Introduction

This section contains **Explanation documentation** for farming module. This content is intended to help readers with their **understanding of farming module and related topics**. It is intended to be discursive, thoughtful, interesting, and occasionally educational. The content includes analysis and review of alternative approaches. 

For further background information please see [the ADR relating to the documentation structure](./ADR/adr-002-docs-structure.md). 

## Layout

The scope and structure of the Explanation documentation follows this layout.

### Topics

Topics are discursive documents that explore some particular feature or theme.  For example, an article might investigate Decentralised Identity Documents or Self-Sovereign Identity.

To contribute, create a folder in [topics](./topics) with a self-descriptive name. Add your content as needed.

### Presentations

The [Presentations](PRESENTATIONS.md) file describes and links to presentations about farming module at various events. Presentations also include YouTube videos,  podcasts, interviews, and so on. 


### Architecture Decisions Records (ADRs)

 ADRs are the mechanism for contributors to raise design proposals. In turn, the ADRs explain for subsequent contributors the rationale behind farming module design and implementation. For example, [ADR 002: Documentation Structure](./ADR/adr-002-docs-structure.md) explains why the farming module documentation structure was chosen. 

See the Architecture Decision Records (ADR) [README](./ADR/README.md) file for more details about how to raise and propose an ADR.

### Articles

This folder contains all articles relating to farming module, includes papers, blog posts, and so on. For details, see [Articles README](articles/README.md).


## Discussions

The explanation content includes articles, topics, and so on, and also includes discussion on relevant channels, including [Pull Requests](https://github.com/tendermint/farming/pulls) and [Issues](https://github.com/tendermint/farming/issues). Important Pull Requests are listed in this document.

Future: farming module currently doesn't have a Discord or Telegram Channel. When we do, the links will be added here as well
