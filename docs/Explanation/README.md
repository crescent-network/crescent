## Introduction

This section contains **Explanation documentation** for farming module. This content is intended to help readers with their **understanding of farming module and related topics**. It is intended to be discursive, thoughtful, interesting, and occasionally educational. The content includes analysis and review of alternative approaches. 

For further background information please see [the ADR relating to the documentation structure](./ADR/adr-002-docs-structure.md). 

## Layout

The scope and structure of the Explanation documentation follows this layout.

### Architecture Decisions Records (ADRs)

 ADRs are the mechanism for contributors to raise design proposals. In turn, the ADRs explain for subsequent contributors the rationale behind farming module design and implementation. For example, [ADR 002: Documentation Structure](./ADR/adr-002-docs-structure.md) explains why the farming module documentation structure was chosen. 

See the Architecture Decision Records (ADR) [README](./ADR/README.md) file for more details about how to raise and propose an ADR.

## Discussions

The explanation content includes articles, topics, and so on, and also includes discussion on relevant channels, including [Pull Requests](https://github.com/tendermint/farming/pulls) and [Issues](https://github.com/tendermint/farming/issues). Important Pull Requests are listed in this document.

Future: farming module currently doesn't have a Discord or Telegram Channel. When we do, the links will be added here as well
