                        A URL/resource name that uniquely identifies the type of
                        the serialized

                        protocol buffer message. This string must contain at
                        least

                        one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path
                        must represent

                        the fully qualified name of the type (as in

                        `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be in
                        a canonical form

                        (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).


                        In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary
                        all types that they

                        expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for
                        URLs which use the

                        scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally
                        set up a type

                        server that maps type URLs to message definitions as
                        follows:


                        * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                        * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a
                        [google.protobuf.Type][]
                          value in binary format, or produce an error.
                        * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based
                        on the
                          URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                          lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                          on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                          breaking changes.)

                        Note: this functionality is not currently available in
                        the official

                        protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs
                        beginning with

                        type.googleapis.com.


                        Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme)
                        might be

                        used with implementation specific semantics.
                    value:
                      type: string
                      format: byte
                      description: >-
                        Must be a valid serialized protocol buffer of the above
                        specified type.
                  description: >-
                    `Any` contains an arbitrary serialized protocol buffer
                    message along with a

                    URL that describes the type of the serialized message.


                    Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values
                    in the form

                    of utility functions or additional generated methods of the
                    Any type.


                    Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any;
                        any.PackFrom(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                          ...
                        }

                    Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                        }

                     Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                        foo = Foo(...)
                        any = Any()
                        any.Pack(foo)
                        ...
                        if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                          any.Unpack(foo)
                          ...

                     Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                         foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                         any, err := ptypes.MarshalAny(foo)
                         ...
                         foo := &pb.Foo{}
                         if err := ptypes.UnmarshalAny(any, foo); err != nil {
                           ...
                         }

                    The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                    default use

                    'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                    unpack

                    methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                    last '/'

                    in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                    type

                    name "y.z".



                    JSON

                    ====

                    The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                          "firstName": <string>,
                          "lastName": <string>
                        }

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                    representation, that representation will be embedded adding
                    a field

                    `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                    `@type`

                    field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",
                          "value": "1.212s"
                        }

                    Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any;
                        any.PackFrom(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                          ...
                        }

                    Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                        }

                     Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                        foo = Foo(...)
                        any = Any()
                        any.Pack(foo)
                        ...
                        if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                          any.Unpack(foo)
                          ...

                     Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                         foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                         any, err := ptypes.MarshalAny(foo)
                         ...
                         foo := &pb.Foo{}
                         if err := ptypes.UnmarshalAny(any, foo); err != nil {
                           ...
                         }

                    The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                    default use

                    'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                    unpack

                    methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                    last '/'

                    in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                    type

                    name "y.z".



                    JSON

                    ====

                    The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                          "firstName": <string>,
                          "lastName": <string>
                        }

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                    representation, that representation will be embedded adding
                    a field

                    `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                    `@type`

                    field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",
                          "value": "1.212s"
                        }
      parameters:

                        A URL/resource name that uniquely identifies the type of
                        the serialized

                        protocol buffer message. This string must contain at
                        least

                        one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path
                        must represent

                        the fully qualified name of the type (as in

                        `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be in
                        a canonical form

                        (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).


                        In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary
                        all types that they

                        expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for
                        URLs which use the

                        scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally
                        set up a type

                        server that maps type URLs to message definitions as
                        follows:


                        * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                        * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a
                        [google.protobuf.Type][]
                          value in binary format, or produce an error.
                        * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based
                        on the
                          URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                          lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                          on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                          breaking changes.)

                        Note: this functionality is not currently available in
                        the official

                        protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs
                        beginning with

                        type.googleapis.com.


                        Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme)
                        might be

                        used with implementation specific semantics.

                    Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values
                    in the form

                    of utility functions or additional generated methods of the
                    Any type.


                    Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any;
                        any.PackFrom(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                          ...
                        }

                    Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                        }

                     Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                        foo = Foo(...)
                        any = Any()
                        any.Pack(foo)
                        ...
                        if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                          any.Unpack(foo)
                          ...

                     Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                         foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                         any, err := ptypes.MarshalAny(foo)
                         ...
                         foo := &pb.Foo{}
                         if err := ptypes.UnmarshalAny(any, foo); err != nil {
                           ...
                         }

                    The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                    default use

                    'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                    unpack

                    methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                    last '/'

                    in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                    type

                    name "y.z".



                    JSON

                    ====

                    The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;

                        A URL/resource name that uniquely identifies the type of
                        the serialized

                        protocol buffer message. This string must contain at
                        least

                        one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path
                        must represent

                        the fully qualified name of the type (as in

                        `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be in
                        a canonical form

                        (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).


                        In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary
                        all types that they

                        expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for
                        URLs which use the

                        scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally
                        set up a type

                        server that maps type URLs to message definitions as
                        follows:


                        * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                        * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a
                        [google.protobuf.Type][]
                          value in binary format, or produce an error.
                        * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based
                        on the
                          URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                          lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                          on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                          breaking changes.)

                        Note: this functionality is not currently available in
                        the official

                        protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs
                        beginning with

                        type.googleapis.com.


                        Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme)
                        might be

                        used with implementation specific semantics.

                    `Any` contains an arbitrary serialized protocol buffer

                    Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values
                    in the form

                    of utility functions or additional generated methods of the
                    Any type.


                    Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any;
                        any.PackFrom(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                          ...
                        }

                    Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                        }

                     Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                        foo = Foo(...)
                        any = Any()
                        any.Pack(foo)
                        ...
                        if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                          any.Unpack(foo)
                          ...

                     Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                         foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                         any, err := ptypes.MarshalAny(foo)
                         ...
                         foo := &pb.Foo{}
                         if err := ptypes.UnmarshalAny(any, foo); err != nil {
                           ...
                         }

                    The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                    default use

                    'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                    unpack

                    methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                    last '/'

                    in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                    type

                    name "y.z".



                    JSON

                    ====

                    The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                          "firstName": <string>,
                          "lastName": <string>
                        }

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                    representation, that representation will be embedded adding
                    a field

                    `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                    `@type`

                    field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                        ...
                        if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                          any.Unpack(foo)
                          ...

                     Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                         foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                         any, err := ptypes.MarshalAny(foo)
                         ...
                         foo := &pb.Foo{}
                         if err := ptypes.UnmarshalAny(any, foo); err != nil {
                           ...
                         }

                    The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                    default use

                    'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                    unpack

                    methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                    last '/'

                    in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                    type

                    name "y.z".



                    JSON

                    ====

                    The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                          "firstName": <string>,
                          "lastName": <string>
                        }

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                    representation, that representation will be embedded adding
                    a field

                    `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                    `@type`

                    field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",

                      one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path must
                      represent

                      the fully qualified name of the type (as in

                      `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be in a
                      canonical form

                      (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).


                      In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary all
                      types that they

                      expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for URLs
                      which use the

                      scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally
                      set up a type

                      server that maps type URLs to message definitions as
                      follows:


                      * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                      * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a
                      [google.protobuf.Type][]
                        value in binary format, or produce an error.
                      * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based
                      on the
                        URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                        lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                        on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                        breaking changes.)

                      Note: this functionality is not currently available in the

                      protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs
                      beginning with

                      type.googleapis.com.


                      Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme)
                      might be

                      used with implementation specific semantics.

                  Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values in
                  the form

                  of utility functions or additional generated methods of the
                  Any type.


                  Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                      Foo foo = ...;
                      Any any;
                      any.PackFrom(foo);
                      ...
                      if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                        ...
                      }

                  Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                      Foo foo = ...;
                      Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                      ...
                      if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                        foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                      }

                   Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                      foo = Foo(...)
                      any = Any()
                      any.Pack(foo)
                      ...
                      if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                        any.Unpack(foo)
                        ...

                   Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                       foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                       any, err := ptypes.MarshalAny(foo)
                       ...
                       foo := &pb.Foo{}
                       if err := ptypes.UnmarshalAny(any, foo); err != nil {
                         ...
                       }

                  The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by default
                  use

                  'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                  unpack

                  methods only use the fully qualified type name after the last
                  '/'

                  in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                  type

                  name "y.z".



                  JSON

                  ====

                  The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                  representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with an

                  additional field `@type` which contains the type URL. Example:

                      package google.profile;
                      message Person {
                        string first_name = 1;
                        string last_name = 2;
                      }

                      {
                        "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                        "firstName": <string>,
                        "lastName": <string>
                      }

                  If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                  JSON

                  representation, that representation will be embedded adding a
                  field

                  `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the `@type`

                  field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                      {
                        "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",

                    Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values
                    in the form

                    of utility functions or additional generated methods of the
                    Any type.


                    Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any;
                        any.PackFrom(foo);

                          ...
                        }

                    Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                        }

                     Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                        foo = Foo(...)
                        any = Any()
                        any.Pack(foo)
                        ...
                        if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                          any.Unpack(foo)
                          ...

                     Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                         foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                         any, err := ptypes.MarshalAny(foo)
                         ...
                         foo := &pb.Foo{}
                         if err := ptypes.UnmarshalAny(any, foo); err != nil {
                           ...
                         }

                    The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                    default use

                    'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                    unpack

                    methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                    last '/'

                    in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                    type

                    name "y.z".



                    JSON

                    ====

                    The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                          "firstName": <string>,
                          "lastName": <string>
                        }

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                    representation, that representation will be embedded adding
                    a field

                    `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                    `@type`

                    field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",
                          "value": "1.212s"

                        A URL/resource name that uniquely identifies the type of
                        the serialized

                        protocol buffer message. This string must contain at
                        least

                        one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path
                        must represent

                        the fully qualified name of the type (as in

                        `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be in
                        a canonical form

                        (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).


                        In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary
                        all types that they

                        expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for
                        URLs which use the

                        scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally
                        set up a type

                        server that maps type URLs to message definitions as
                        follows:


                        * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                        * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a
                        [google.protobuf.Type][]
                          value in binary format, or produce an error.
                        * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based
                        on the
                          URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                          lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                          on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                          breaking changes.)

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                    representation, that representation will be embedded adding
                    a field

                    `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the

                        A URL/resource name that uniquely identifies the type of
                        the serialized

                        protocol buffer message. This string must contain at
                        least

                        one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path
                        must represent

                        the fully qualified name of the type (as in

                        `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be in
                        a canonical form

                        (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).


                        In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary
                        all types that they

                        expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for
                        URLs which use the

                        scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally
                        set up a type

                        server that maps type URLs to message definitions as
                        follows:


                        * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                        * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a
                        [google.protobuf.Type][]
                          value in binary format, or produce an error.
                        * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based
                        on the
                          URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                          lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                          on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                          breaking changes.)

                        Note: this functionality is not currently available in
                        the official

                        protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs
                        beginning with

                        type.googleapis.com.


                        Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme)
                        might be

                        used with implementation specific semantics.

                    Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values
                    in the form

                    of utility functions or additional generated methods of the
                    Any type.


                    Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any;
                        any.PackFrom(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                          ...
                        }

                    Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                        }

                     Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                        foo = Foo(...)
                        any = Any()
                        any.Pack(foo)
                        ...
                        if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                          any.Unpack(foo)
                          ...

                     Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                         foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                         any, err := ptypes.MarshalAny(foo)
                         ...
                         foo := &pb.Foo{}
                         if err := ptypes.UnmarshalAny(any, foo); err != nil {
                           ...
                         }

                    The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                    default use

                    'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                    unpack

                    methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                    last '/'

                    in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                    type

                    name "y.z".



                    JSON

                    ====

                    The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                          "firstName": <string>,
                          "lastName": <string>
                        }

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                    representation, that representation will be embedded adding
                    a field

                    `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                    `@type`

                    field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",

                        protocol buffer message. This string must contain at

                        (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).

                        all types that they

                        expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for
                        URLs which use the

                        scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally
                        set up a type

                        server that maps type URLs to message definitions as

                        * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                        * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a

                        * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based
                        on the
                          URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                          lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                          on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                          breaking changes.)

                        Note: this functionality is not currently available in

                        Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme)
                        might be

                    Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values
                    in the form

                    of utility functions or additional generated methods of the
                    Any type.


                    Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any;
                        any.PackFrom(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                          ...
                        }

                    Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                        }

                     Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                        foo = Foo(...)
                        any = Any()
                        any.Pack(foo)
                        ...
                        if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                          any.Unpack(foo)
                          ...

                     Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                         foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                         any, err := ptypes.MarshalAny(foo)
                         ...
                         foo := &pb.Foo{}
                         if err := ptypes.UnmarshalAny(any, foo); err != nil {
                           ...
                         }

                    The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                    default use

                    'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                    unpack

                    methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                    last '/'

                    in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                    type

                    name "y.z".



                    JSON

                    ====

                    The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                          "firstName": <string>,
                          "lastName": <string>
                        }

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                    representation, that representation will be embedded adding
                    a field

                    `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                    `@type`

                    field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",

                    Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values
                    in the form

                    of utility functions or additional generated methods of the
                    Any type.


                    Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any;
                        any.PackFrom(foo);

                          ...
                        }

                    Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                        }

                     Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                        foo = Foo(...)
                        any = Any()
                        any.Pack(foo)
                        ...

                          any.Unpack(foo)

                     Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                         foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                         any, err := ptypes.MarshalAny(foo)

                         if err := ptypes.UnmarshalAny(any, foo); err != nil {
                           ...
                         }

                    The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                    default use

                    'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                    unpack

                    methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                    last '/'

                    in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                    type

                    name "y.z".



                    JSON

                    ====

                    The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                          "firstName": <string>,
                          "lastName": <string>
                        }

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                    representation, that representation will be embedded adding
                    a field

                    `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                    `@type`

                    field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",

                        A URL/resource name that uniquely identifies the type of
                        the serialized

                        protocol buffer message. This string must contain at
                        least

                        one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path
                        must represent

                        the fully qualified name of the type (as in

                        `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be in
                        a canonical form

                        (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).


                        In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary
                        all types that they

                        expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for
                        URLs which use the

                        scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally
                        set up a type

                        server that maps type URLs to message definitions as
                        follows:


                        * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                        * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a
                        [google.protobuf.Type][]
                          value in binary format, or produce an error.
                        * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based
                        on the
                          URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                          lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                          on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                          breaking changes.)

                        Note: this functionality is not currently available in
                        the official

                        protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs
                        beginning with

                        type.googleapis.com.


                        Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme)
                        might be

                        used with implementation specific semantics.

                        A URL/resource name that uniquely identifies the type of
                        the serialized

                        protocol buffer message. This string must contain at
                        least

                        one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path
                        must represent

                        the fully qualified name of the type (as in

                        `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be in
                        a canonical form

                        (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).


                        In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary
                        all types that they

                        expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for
                        URLs which use the

                        scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally
                        set up a type

                        server that maps type URLs to message definitions as
                        follows:


                        * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                        * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a
                        [google.protobuf.Type][]
                          value in binary format, or produce an error.
                        * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based
                        on the
                          URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                          lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                          on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                          breaking changes.)

                        Note: this functionality is not currently available in
                        the official

                        protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs
                        beginning with

                        type.googleapis.com.


                        Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme)
                        might be

                        used with implementation specific semantics.

                    `Any` contains an arbitrary serialized protocol buffer

                    Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values
                    in the form

                    of utility functions or additional generated methods of the
                    Any type.


                    Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any;
                        any.PackFrom(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                          ...
                        }

                    Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                        }

                     Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                        foo = Foo(...)
                        any = Any()
                        any.Pack(foo)
                        ...
                        if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                          any.Unpack(foo)
                          ...

                     Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                         foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                         any, err := ptypes.MarshalAny(foo)
                         ...
                         foo := &pb.Foo{}
                         if err := ptypes.UnmarshalAny(any, foo); err != nil {
                           ...
                         }

                    The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                    default use

                    'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                    unpack

                    methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                    last '/'

                    in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                    type

                    name "y.z".



                    JSON

                    ====

                    The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                          "firstName": <string>,
                          "lastName": <string>
                        }

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                    representation, that representation will be embedded adding
                    a field

                    `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                    `@type`

                    field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",

                        the serialized

                        protocol buffer message. This string must contain at
                        least

                        one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path
                        must represent

                        the fully qualified name of the type (as in

                        `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be in
                        a canonical form

                        (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).


                        In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary
                        all types that they

                        expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for
                        URLs which use the

                        scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally
                        set up a type

                        server that maps type URLs to message definitions as
                        follows:


                        * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                        * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a
                        [google.protobuf.Type][]
                          value in binary format, or produce an error.
                        * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based
                        on the
                          URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                          lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                          on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                          breaking changes.)

                        Note: this functionality is not currently available in
                        the official

                        protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs
                        beginning with

                        type.googleapis.com.


                        Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme)
                        might be

                        used with implementation specific semantics.

                    `Any` contains an arbitrary serialized protocol buffer
                    message along with a

                    URL that describes the type of the serialized message.


                    Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values
                    in the form

                    of utility functions or additional generated methods of the
                    Any type.


                    Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any;
                        any.PackFrom(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                          ...
                        }

                    Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                        }

                     Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                        foo = Foo(...)
                        any = Any()
                        any.Pack(foo)
                        ...
                        if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                          any.Unpack(foo)
                          ...

                     Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                         foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                         any, err := ptypes.MarshalAny(foo)
                         ...
                         foo := &pb.Foo{}
                         if err := ptypes.UnmarshalAny(any, foo); err != nil {
                           ...
                         }

                    The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                    default use

                    'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                    unpack

                    methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                    last '/'

                    in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                    type

                    name "y.z".



                    JSON

                    ====

                    The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                          "firstName": <string>,
                          "lastName": <string>
                        }

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                    representation, that representation will be embedded adding
                    a field

                    `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                    `@type`

                    field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",
                          "value": "1.212s"
                        }

                    unpack

                    methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                    last '/'

                    in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                    type

                    name "y.z".



                    JSON

                    ====

                    The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

                    representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with
                    an

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                          "firstName": <string>,
                          "lastName": <string>
                        }

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                    representation, that representation will be embedded adding
                    a field

                    `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                    `@type`

                    field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",

                        A URL/resource name that uniquely identifies the type of
                        the serialized

                        protocol buffer message. This string must contain at
                        least

                        one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path
                        must represent

                        the fully qualified name of the type (as in

                        `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be in
                        a canonical form

                        (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).


                        In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary
                        all types that they

                        expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for
                        URLs which use the

                        scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally
                        set up a type

                        server that maps type URLs to message definitions as
                        follows:


                        * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                        * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a
                        [google.protobuf.Type][]
                          value in binary format, or produce an error.
                        * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based
                        on the
                          URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                          lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                          on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                          breaking changes.)

                        Note: this functionality is not currently available in
                        the official

                        protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs
                        beginning with

                        type.googleapis.com.


                        Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme)
                        might be

                        used with implementation specific semantics.

                    Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values
                    in the form

                    of utility functions or additional generated methods of the
                    Any type.


                    Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any;
                        any.PackFrom(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                          ...
                        }

                    Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                        Foo foo = ...;
                        Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                        ...
                        if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                          foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                        }

                     Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                        foo = Foo(...)
                        any = Any()
                        any.Pack(foo)
                        ...
                        if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                          any.Unpack(foo)
                          ...

                     Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                         foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                         any, err := ptypes.MarshalAny(foo)
                         ...
                         foo := &pb.Foo{}
                         if err := ptypes.UnmarshalAny(any, foo); err != nil {
                           ...
                         }

                    The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by
                    default use

                    'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the
                    unpack

                    methods only use the fully qualified type name after the
                    last '/'

                    in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield
                    type

                    name "y.z".

                    additional field `@type` which contains the type URL.
                    Example:

                        package google.profile;
                        message Person {
                          string first_name = 1;
                          string last_name = 2;
                        }

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                          "firstName": <string>,
                          "lastName": <string>
                        }

                    If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom
                    JSON

                    representation, that representation will be embedded adding
                    a field

                    `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the
                    `@type`

                    field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

                        {
                          "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",
                          "value": "1.212s"
                        }

              one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path must
              represent

              the fully qualified name of the type (as in

              `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be in a
              canonical form

              (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).


              In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary all types
              that they

              expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for URLs which
              use the

              scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally set up a
              type

              server that maps type URLs to message definitions as follows:


              * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

              * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a [google.protobuf.Type][]
                value in binary format, or produce an error.
              * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based on the
                URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                breaking changes.)

              Note: this functionality is not currently available in the
              official

              protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs beginning with

              type.googleapis.com.


              Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme) might be

              used with implementation specific semantics.

          Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values in the
          form

          of utility functions or additional generated methods of the Any type.


          Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

              Any any;
              any.PackFrom(foo);

              if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                ...
              }

          Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

              Foo foo = ...;
              Any any = Any.pack(foo);
              ...
              if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);

           Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

              foo = Foo(...)
              any = Any()
              any.Pack(foo)
              ...
              if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                any.Unpack(foo)
                ...

           Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

               foo := &pb.Foo{...}
               any, err := ptypes.MarshalAny(foo)
               ...
               foo := &pb.Foo{}
               if err := ptypes.UnmarshalAny(any, foo); err != nil {
                 ...
               }

          The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by default use

          'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the unpack

          methods only use the fully qualified type name after the last '/'

          in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield type

          name "y.z".



          JSON

          ====

          The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

          representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with an

          additional field `@type` which contains the type URL. Example:

              package google.profile;
              message Person {
                string first_name = 1;
                string last_name = 2;
              }

              {
                "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
                "firstName": <string>,
                "lastName": <string>
              }

          If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom JSON

          representation, that representation will be embedded adding a field

          `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the `@type`

          field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

              {
                "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",
                "value": "1.212s"
              }

                serialized

                protocol buffer message. This string must contain at least

                one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path must
                represent

                the fully qualified name of the type (as in

                `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be in a
                canonical form

                (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).


                In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary all types
                that they

                expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for URLs which
                use the

                scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally set up
                a type

                server that maps type URLs to message definitions as follows:


                * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

                * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a [google.protobuf.Type][]
                  value in binary format, or produce an error.
                * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based on the
                  URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
                  lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
                  on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
                  breaking changes.)

                Note: this functionality is not currently available in the
                official

                protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs beginning
                with

                type.googleapis.com.


                Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme) might
                be

                used with implementation specific semantics.

            Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values in the
            form

            of utility functions or additional generated methods of the Any
            type.


            Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

                Foo foo = ...;
                Any any;
                any.PackFrom(foo);
                ...
                if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
                  ...
                }

            Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

                Foo foo = ...;
                Any any = Any.pack(foo);
                ...
                if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
                  foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
                }

             Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

                foo = Foo(...)
                any = Any()
                any.Pack(foo)
                ...
                if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
                  any.Unpack(foo)
                  ...

             Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

                 foo := &pb.Foo{...}
                 any, err := ptypes.MarshalAny(foo)
                 ...
                 foo := &pb.Foo{}
                 if err := ptypes.UnmarshalAny(any, foo); err != nil {
                   ...
                 }

            The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by default use

            'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the unpack

            methods only use the fully qualified type name after the last '/'

            ====

            The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

            representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with an

            additional field `@type` which contains the type URL. Example:

                package google.profile;
                message Person {
                  string first_name = 1;
                  string last_name = 2;
                }

                {

          A URL/resource name that uniquely identifies the type of the
          serialized

          protocol buffer message. This string must contain at least

          one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path must represent

          the fully qualified name of the type (as in

          `path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be in a canonical
          form

          (e.g., leading "." is not accepted).


          In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary all types that
          they

          expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for URLs which use
          the

          scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally set up a type

          server that maps type URLs to message definitions as follows:


          * If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.

          * An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a [google.protobuf.Type][]
            value in binary format, or produce an error.
          * Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based on the
            URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any
            lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved
            on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage
            breaking changes.)

          Note: this functionality is not currently available in the official

          protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs beginning with

          type.googleapis.com.


          Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme) might be

          used with implementation specific semantics.

      `Any` contains an arbitrary serialized protocol buffer message along with

      Protobuf library provides support to pack/unpack Any values in the form

      of utility functions or additional generated methods of the Any type.


      Example 1: Pack and unpack a message in C++.

          Foo foo = ...;
          Any any;
          any.PackFrom(foo);
          ...
          if (any.UnpackTo(&foo)) {
            ...
          }

      Example 2: Pack and unpack a message in Java.

          Foo foo = ...;
          Any any = Any.pack(foo);
          ...
          if (any.is(Foo.class)) {
            foo = any.unpack(Foo.class);
          }

       Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

          foo = Foo(...)
          any = Any()
          any.Pack(foo)
          ...
          if any.Is(Foo.DESCRIPTOR):
            any.Unpack(foo)
            ...

       Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go

           foo := &pb.Foo{...}
           any, err := ptypes.MarshalAny(foo)
           ...
           foo := &pb.Foo{}
           if err := ptypes.UnmarshalAny(any, foo); err != nil {
             ...
           }

      The pack methods provided by protobuf library will by default use

      'type.googleapis.com/full.type.name' as the type URL and the unpack

      methods only use the fully qualified type name after the last '/'

      in the type URL, for example "foo.bar.com/x/y.z" will yield type

      name "y.z".



      JSON

      ====

      The JSON representation of an `Any` value uses the regular

      representation of the deserialized, embedded message, with an

      additional field `@type` which contains the type URL. Example:

          package google.profile;
          message Person {
            string first_name = 1;
            string last_name = 2;
          }

          {
            "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.profile.Person",
            "firstName": <string>,
            "lastName": <string>
          }

      If the embedded message type is well-known and has a custom JSON

      representation, that representation will be embedded adding a field

      `value` which holds the custom JSON in addition to the `@type`

      field. Example (for message [google.protobuf.Duration][]):

          {
            "@type": "type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.Duration",
            "value": "1.212s"
          }

                one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path must
                represent

                the fully qualified name of the type (as in

                canonical form

                scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally set up

                type.googleapis.com.


                Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme) might
                be

                used with implementation specific semantics.

             Example 3: Pack and unpack a message in Python.

             Example 4: Pack and unpack a message in Go
