# Contributing

We welcome contributions from anyone who is willing to create a new PR on farming module, make sure that you read and comply with this document. See the [open issues](https://github.com/tendermint/farming/issues) that we need help with. Feel free to inform us if you are willing to work on any issue. Note that the `master` branch contains the latest development version. 

We follow standard github best practices: 

- Fork the repository
- Make sure your `branch` is from the tip of `master` branch
- Make some commits to resolve an issue
- Submit a pull request to `master`

Rule of thumb:

- Make sure you run tests by running `make test-all` locally to see there is any issue
- Review all the checks on your PR and review code coverage report
- Assign reviewers from code owners (@dongsam @kogisin @hallazzang)
